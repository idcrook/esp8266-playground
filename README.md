# esp8266-playground

Collection of personal adventures, starting with ESP-01 module

## Loading firmware wih FTDI USB Serial cable

The very first thing to do with the ESP8266 is to figure out how to program firmware onto its module.

 [Using USB to TTL Serial cable to program ESP-01](Breadboard_Programmer_USB_TTL_FT232R_3v3/README.md)

## TODO

 - Program back "stock" firmware
 - Use as a WiFi link to ATtiny85
 - Use as a WiFi link to arduino uC
 - make a "sensor" station (perhaps a solar powered outdoor weather station)
