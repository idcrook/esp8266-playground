# esp8266-playground

Collection of personal adventures, starting with ESP-01 module

## Loading firmware wih FTDI USB Serial cable

The very first thing to do with the ESP8266 is to figure out how to program firmware onto its module.

 [Using USB to TTL Serial cable to program ESP-01](Breadboard_Programmer_USB_TTL_FT232R_3v3/README.md)


## Build AT Firmware for ESP-01 module

[Developer steps](build-ESP-AT/README.md)

- Working on an ESP-01S with 4MB (32 Mbit) Flash
- not tried on ESP-01 (blue) modules with 512 kB (4 Mbit) Flash


## TODO

 - Use as a MQTT bridge for Rasperry Pi Pico
 - Use as a WiFi link to ATtiny85
 - Use as a WiFi link to arduino uC
 - make a "sensor" station (perhaps a solar powered outdoor weather station)
